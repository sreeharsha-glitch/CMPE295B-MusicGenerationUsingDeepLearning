## Project Architecture

## Project description
In this project, we propose deep learning techniques to create music samples. Our aim is to experiment with multiple deep learning concepts like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Auto Encoders (VAEs), Transformers in generating music. The expected outcome is to generate novel music samples of a particular genre and in the long term help the patients who are in need of physical and emotional strength.
